// Step 1: Add 1 and 4
let sum = 1 + 4;

// Step 2: Subtract 2 from sum
let difference = sum - 2;

// Step 3: Multiply difference by 5
let product = difference * 5;

// Step 4: Divide product by 2
let quotient = product / 2;

// Step 5: Get remainder of product divided by 2
let remainder = product % 2;

// Step 6: Display quotient in the HTML element with id "result"
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = quotient;
